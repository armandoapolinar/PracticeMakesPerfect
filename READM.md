Hi Jon
Im going to create two new text documents with questions. 
Your job, is to answer them and then create two new text documents of your own questions for me to answer.
Once you've answered my questions and created your own text documents with questions for me to answer
Push and commit this back to the Remote repositroy(gitHub). 

I hope this work and lets have some fun with this :D
